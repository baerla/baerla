I'm currently studying Entrepreneurial Cybersecurity (M.Eng.) at Saarland University.

As a dual student I'm working at dc AG, where I have finished my apprenticeship in February 2021 and I'm now working as a System Operator in the Operations team there.

🌱 I’m currently learning "systems security"🔐, "side-channel attacks🔨 and defenses"🛡️ and "fuzzing"

💬 Ask me about docker🐋, software architecture and formula one🏎️
